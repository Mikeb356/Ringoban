# Ringoban
A Sokoban clone in Applesoft BASIC
The aim of this project is to create a version of Sokoban written entirely in Applesoft BASIC.

Initially, at least, it will use the text screen, but using Mousetext characters to give it somewhat of a graphical "feel".

So far, the main aim is achieved. It is fully playable. However, enhancements are always possible and comments are welcome.
