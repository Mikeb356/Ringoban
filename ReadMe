A Sokoban clone in Applesoft BASIC The aim of this project is to create a version of Sokoban written entirely in Applesoft BASIC.

Initially, at least, it will use the text screen, but using Mousetext characters to give it somewhat of a graphical "feel".

So far, the main aim is achieved. It is fully playable. However, enhancements are always possible and comments are welcome.

Currently working on version 2.0
Enhancements:
01 - more levels directories
02 - menu-selectable directories & levels
03 - save game feature. Not the same as "snapshot". Can have up to 10 (0 - 9) games
04 - no longer fits on 140 kB disk, requires 800 kB
